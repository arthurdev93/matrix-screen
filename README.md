# matrix-screen
green screen from MATRIX movies, made with JAVASCRIPT

At some points in the film, they show these "codes", which much later we've discovered to be sushi recipes using hiragana, katakana, kanji and a few other symbols. These symbols in turn fall across the screen, making the famous "Matrix rain" effect.
